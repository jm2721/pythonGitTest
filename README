An encrypter that takes a one or many words and encrypts them according to Rabin's Method.
Then the decrypter decrypts the code and returns the four square roots. The user can then see
which square root is the alphabet code (a = 01, b = 02, etc) of a word (there is always only one), 
and then easily decipher it to see what the word was.
I tried to have the code decide which was the correct square root, but it proved to be very difficult
to do so. It involves a lot of loops, and many different checks.
Also includes some random helper functions for modular arithmetic.
